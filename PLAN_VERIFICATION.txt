PLAN CROSS-VERIFICATION NOTES
=============================
1. Storage capabilities check (js/storage/storage.js lines 13-350) shows no helper for transient execution errors; only reasoning/execution/tool logs exist, therefore introducing LS_KEYS + helpers is safe and necessary.
2. JSExecutor (js/execution/js-executor.js lines 1-150) serialises every automatic code run and already has the error metadata we need before persisting reasoning logs, confirming it is the right interception point for populating the pending context.
3. Reasoning context assembly (js/reasoning/context/providers/index.js & js/config/reasoning-config.js) clearly enumerates provider IDs; adding a new provider + section will automatically flow into ReasoningEngine.buildContextPrompt without touching parser code.
4. LoopController.runIteration (js/control/loop-controller.js lines 150-520) gates every iteration start/end, so marking pending warnings as served and clearing them after scheduling the next iteration can be centralised there without missing cases.
5. Renderer.renderReasoningLog (js/ui/renderer/renderer-reasoning.js) currently pipes entire entries through marked.parse without special casing CODE/ERROR blocks, so augmenting it with <pre>-wrapping is both feasible and aligns with the user requirement.
6. Tool-registry self-closing patterns (js/config/tool-registry-config.js lines 150-320) currently use /[^>]* capture groups, so any '>' inside quoted attribute values is clipped; switching to non-greedy [\s\S]*? still scopes each operation because the terminator is the next '/>}' literal.
7. unified-tool-parser's extractByPattern (js/reasoning/parser/unified-tool-parser.js lines 32-74) simply trusts the captured attribute blob; once the regex is broadened, no other modules need adjustments because attribute parsing already tolerates embedded '>' characters via [^"']*.
8. Verified regex builder usage (js/config/tool-registry-config.js lines 34-110 & 150-305) to ensure every tool now routes through the helper and accepts multiline attributes.
9. Spot-checked the new attribute state machine and telemetry (js/config/tool-registry-config.js:520+, js/reasoning/parser/unified-tool-parser.js:13-40,90-120) with manual fixtures to confirm `{{<task notes="Line > Line" />}}` parses without truncation and suspicious blocks emit warnings only when quotes are unbalanced.
