CONTEXT CLEANUP PLAN
=====================
Problem: JS execution errors still appear inside reasoning logs (see iteration #4 entry), even though the dedicated pending-error provider already delivers the mandated instruction block. Need the context window to stay pristine once the next reply is error-free.

1. Recon
   - Inspect JSExecutor._recordReasoningLog, Storage.saveReasoningLog/loadReasoningLog, and any other writers (final-output failure logging) to understand how error entries are recorded and rendered.
   - Confirm reasoning context builder reads logs directly (ReasoningContextBuilder -> ReasoningStateSnapshot -> Storage.loadReasoningLog) so any persisted error lines bleed straight into prompts.

2. Logging policy change
   - Update JSExecutor so failed runs no longer append '=== JAVASCRIPT EXECUTION ERROR ===' blocks to the reasoning log; rely solely on the existing pending error context + execution log for diagnostics.
   - Keep success logging unchanged to preserve historical context for successful executions.

3. Retroactive cleanup
   - Introduce a Storage helper that scrubs transient error entries (JS execution errors and final-output verification failures) from the reasoning log whenever they are encountered.
   - Invoke this cleanup at safe checkpoints (e.g., start of each iteration and whenever we detect a newly successful JS execution) so legacy entries disappear as soon as the model recovers.

4. Rendering safeguards
   - Ensure renderer / context provider layers handle absence of these entries gracefully (no blank artifacts) and keep the <pre> formatting requirement intact for the pending error block only.

5. Verification
   - Add PLAN_VERIFICATION notes referencing the touched files and log before/after reasoning log samples showing that error entries are gone after a clean iteration.
   - Record each milestone in PROGRESS_TRACKER per compliance requirements.
