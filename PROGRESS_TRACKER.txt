PROGRESS TRACKER
================
[2025-11-07T20:15:00Z] Deleted all *.md files per compliance instruction.
[2025-11-07T20:17:00Z] Created TEMP_KNOWLEDGE.txt capturing current architecture insights.
[2025-11-07T20:20:00Z] Authored MASTER_PLAN.txt outlining seven remediation steps.
[2025-11-07T20:22:00Z] Logged PLAN_VERIFICATION.txt after cross-checking each plan item against the codebase.
[2025-11-07T20:30:00Z] Added LS_KEYS.PENDING_EXECUTION_ERROR and Storage helpers to load/save/serve/clear transient execution error context.
[2025-11-07T20:40:00Z] Updated JSExecutor to capture auto-run failures into Storage.savePendingExecutionError with vault reference metadata.
[2025-11-07T20:42:00Z] Added pending-error context provider + reasoning section and wired LoopController to mark/clear single-use warnings.
[2025-11-07T20:48:00Z] Updated renderer-reasoning to wrap CODE/CONSOLE/ERROR sections in <pre> blocks (markdown bypass + fallback encoding).
[2025-11-07T20:55:00Z] Prepared final response summary (location answer + verification guidance).
[2025-11-07T21:05:00Z] Adjusted pending-error provider to wrap code/errors directly in <pre> blocks to match compliance wording.
[2025-11-07T21:30:00Z] Phase 2 plan appended covering session guard + log hygiene objectives.
[2025-11-07T21:34:00Z] Updated ReasoningSessionManager.shouldContinue + LoopController gate so only true consecutive error streaks halt sessions and the guard now finishes the session cleanly.
[2025-11-07T21:36:00Z] Sanitized JS execution error logging so failed code/stack is redacted from the reasoning log (details live only in the pending error context).
[2025-11-07T21:50:00Z] Removed ReasoningSessionManager.shouldContinue guard and LoopController check so sessions no longer auto-stop from guard logic.
[2025-11-07T22:08:00Z] Documented Phase 3 plan targeting self-closing tool parser truncation after formatting audit.
[2025-11-07T22:12:00Z] Updated memory/task/goal/datavault regex patterns to use non-greedy [\\s\\S]*? captures (block + self-closing) so quoted text with '>' or newlines stays intact.
